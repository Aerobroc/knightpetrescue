<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Knight Pet Rescue is a nonprofit animal shelter dedicated to finding new homes for the animals brought in. We find our animals on the streets, from kill shelters, and from the various people who bring them in. We vaccinate, wash, feed, and take care of our animals with the love they deserve and we hope that every one of them will find an owner that will be much more than a companion, but a family member instead.</p>
